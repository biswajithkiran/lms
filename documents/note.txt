Pending sections

Admin interface
-------------------------
Need to do the admin interface so we can manage the leads before getting to agent interface.
Check for duplicate lead,fake lead etc admin admin can approve the leads according to it.
We need to show only admin approved leads to agent side

Time zone conversion
-----------------------------------
Need to make all leads to a common time zone(UTC) So we can make sure the excat date of 
registration of the lead when it is considered globaly.

Setting unique Lead ID
-----------------------------------
By setting a unique lead id (depending on the session), we can avoid the duplicate leads, robot generated 
leads etc with respect to the IP address.We can set a unique id when a visitor visits the campaign page and 
thus redirected to the landing page.Or otherwise we have to check for duplicate lead details when a user submitting the form.This may take time for 
saving the process. Or in admin side we have to check for the duplicate leads automatically or manualy.

Incompleted form or quiting the page before submitting the data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section is not completed and I will do it as early as possible.

Set the campaign Id
---------------------------
Campaign id must be saved and for that we need to get the id when a user is redirected to the landing 
page through the campaign. In current code ,I have hard coded the campaign id as 4 and saving it in the 
database.While generating the report and taking weekly or monthly analysis, we can understand through which
campaign we got more leads

Dashboard
----------------
Need to show the number of leads with different status



Changes completed on 17/01/2019
-------------------------------------------------------

Agent side dashboard
--------------------------------
Completed the agent side dashboard for showing total leads,admin approved leads,approval pending leads,
duplicate leads.

New lead_id is implementd
_______________________
A session id is also added in the form to uniquely identify the leads is implemented.Using this concept, we can
avoid duplicate leads,unauthorized insertion of lead data,insertion through robotic methods etc.


Saving the incompleted lead form data
----------------------------------------------------------
This is done by calling an ajax function on mouseleave event . When mouse leaves the document area, the 
available data in the form is saved along with lead_id(session value, newly implemented),ip address,and with
status as 'I' (incomplete).

Next time if mouse leaves the document area,system checks for the lead_id in the database,if lead_id exists,
the corresponding lead will be modified.
